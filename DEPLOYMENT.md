# Deployment

To deploy this project, you're going to need to acquire a server running some flavor of Linux. You'll need the `docker-compose` and `git` commands; depending on your distribution, you may need to install these onto the server before continuing.

You're also going to need a domain name that points to your server's IP address. (If you don't want to buy a domain name, consider using [nip.io](https://nip.io/); this is a website with the property that, if you take an arbitrary IP address—say, 172.105.105.10—the domain name `172.105.105.10.nip.io` will automatically point to that IP address.)

Let's suppose we're using the domain **`172.105.105.10.nip.io.`**
